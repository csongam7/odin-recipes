      If you love lasagna, but don’t love the time and effort it takes to do all
      that layering, then this amazing lasagna soup is for you. Unlike many of
      the other lasagna soup recipes online, this is way more than just some
      pasta, meat, and cheese sitting in a bowl of thinned out tomato sauce.
      This is real lasagna in soup form.

      Anyway, I loved how this came out, and I think one of the secrets is
      baking the pasta to give it more of the taste and texture of an actual
      baked lasagna noodle. They may not have looked much different in the final
      product, but I found the texture to be far superior to the standard
      technique, which is just to heat up some cooked pasta in the finished
      soup. So I do recommend the extra few minutes of prep, but either way, if
      you’re in the mood for lasagna, but aren’t into the whole production, I
      really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!
