    <p>
      If you love lasagna, but don’t love the time and effort it takes to do all
      that layering, then this amazing lasagna soup is for you. Unlike many of
      the other lasagna soup recipes online, this is way more than just some
      pasta, meat, and cheese sitting in a bowl of thinned out tomato sauce.
      This is real lasagna in soup form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, I loved how this came out, and I think one of the secrets is
      baking the pasta to give it more of the taste and texture of an actual
      baked lasagna noodle. They may not have looked much different in the final
      product, but I found the texture to be far superior to the standard
      technique, which is just to heat up some cooked pasta in the finished
      soup. So I do recommend the extra few minutes of prep, but either way, if
      you’re in the mood for lasagna, but aren’t into the whole production, I
      really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!

      </li>
      <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh italian parsley</li>

      <li>1/2 cup torn fresh basil and italian parsley leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.
        Stir in lasagna noodles and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered,
        stirring occasionally, until just flexible, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer
        noodles into cold water until cooled; drain very well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with parchment paper, and grease parchment with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut noodles in half lengthwise. Arrange noodles in evenly overlapping
        rows on the prepared baking sheet. Brush with melted butter, and use
        fingers to rub some butter between the noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake noodles in the preheated oven until they are golden, blistered, and
        are beginning to brown with crispy outside edges. Let cool; cut into
        bite-sized pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to a soup pot, and place over high heat. Add
        beef and sausage. Use a spatula to break up the meat into small pieces;
        cook without stirring until liquid evaporates and meat begins to sizzle
        in its own fat, then continue to cook and stir until meat begins to
        brown, about 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add onions, garlic, tomato paste, red pepper flakes, dried oregano,
        black pepper, and kosher salt. Cook and stir until onions begin to turn
        translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in chicken broth, tomato sauce, and water. Bring to a simmer,
        reduce heat to medium low, and simmer for 45 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, stir ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese
        together; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase the heat under soup to medium high; stir in noodle pieces.
        Cook, stirring, until pasta is tender, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to
        low, and stir in the 2 tablespoons Italian parsley.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve in bowls with a scoop of cheese mixture, and sprinkle with freshly
        torn basil and Italian parsley if desired.
