      These 3-ingredient banana oatmeal cookies—just oats, bananas, and
      raisins—make a great alternative breakfast for when you're on the go, or
      you can pack them in the kids’ lunch boxes for a healthier snack.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3/4 cup mashed banana</li>
      <li>1/2 cup rolled oats</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons raisins</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir bananas and oats together in a bowl until well combined. Stir in
        raisins. Using a medium sized cookie scoop, drop dough onto the prepared
        baking sheet. Using your fingers, gently pat down dough to form a round
        cookie.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until beginning to brown on the bottom, 14 to
        15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
